# Telecom-Churn-Analysis
This project aims to predict customer churn by analyzing the behavior of a telecom company's customers. Throughout the study, various analyses were conducted on the dataset, and a model capable of predicting customer churn with high accuracy was developed. The proposed model is designed to help businesses minimize customer attrition and enhance customer loyalty.

Machine learning algorithms were utilized to develop the models. Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM were employed in this process. These models were trained and tested on the processed dataset.

LightGBM was chosen as the final model due to its high recall and F-beta scores, making it effective in identifying customer churn. The analysis suggests that customers with monthly contracts, short tenure, fiber optic internet, and electronic check payments are more likely to churn, requiring targeted retention strategies.
